** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To understand the concepts of ADTs
- To design linear data structures – lists, stacks, and queues
- To understand sorting, searching and hashing algorithms
- To apply Tree and Graph structures

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT I | ABSTRACT DATA TYPES | 10 |
Abstract Data Types (ADTs) – ADTs and classes – introduction to OOP –
classes in Python – inheritance – namespaces – shallow and deep
copying Introduction to analysis of algorithms – asymptotic notations
– recursion – analyzing recursive algorithms

{{{unit}}}
| UNIT II | LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES | 8 |
List ADT – array-based implementations – linked list implementations –
singly linked lists – circularly linked lists – doubly linked lists –
applications of lists – Stack ADT – Queue ADT – double ended queues


{{{unit}}}
| UNIT III | SORTING AND SEARCHING   | 9 |
Bubble sort – selection sort – insertion sort – merge sort – quick
sort – linear search – binary search – hashing – hash functions –
collision handling – load factors, rehashing, and efficiency


{{{unit}}}
| UNIT IV | TREE STRUCTURES | 9 |
Tree ADT – Binary Tree ADT – tree traversals – binary search trees –
AVL trees – heaps – multi-way search trees


{{{unit}}}
| UNIT V | GRAPH STRUCTURES | 9 |
Graph ADT – representations of graph – graph traversals – DAG –
topological ordering – shortest paths – minimum spanning trees

\hfill *Total Periods: 45*

** COURSE OUTCOMES
After the completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Explain abstract data types
- Design, implement, and analyse linear data structures, such as
  lists, queues, and stacks, according to the needs of different
  applications
- Design, implement, and analyse efficient tree structures to meet
  requirements such as searching, indexing, and sorting
- Model problems as graph problems and implement efficient graph
  algorithms to solve them.
