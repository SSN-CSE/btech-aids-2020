** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- Understand and apply suitable data structures, linear and nonlinear
- Understand the concepts and differences in searching and sorting
  techniques
- Learn hashing table, sets, maps and heaps


** SUGGESTIVE EXPERIMENTS
1. Writing simple Python programs using objects
2. Writing recursive functions(e.g.recursive function that takes a
   string like ``abcdefgh'' and returns ``badcfehg'')
3. Implement and compare sorting algorithms (e.g. Write a program that
   times the quicksort, the merge sort, and the built-in sort
   algorithms in Python to discover which one is better and to see
   their relative speeds)
4. Implement a circular queue using linked list.
5. Implement a stack using linked list (e.g.Infix evaluator program)
6. Implement binary search (e.g. build a PyList or just a Python list
   of values, sorts them, and then looks up random values within the
   list)
7. Implement circular doubly linked list (e.g. implement Josephus
   problem)
8. Implement binary tree and its traversal algorithms(e.g. Form an
   expression tree using input prefix expression, get postfix and
   infix forms, evaluate the expression)
9. Implement binary search tree operations.(e.g. Telephone directory)
10. Implement AVL trees
11. Implement priority queue using binary heaps (e.g. Storing employee
    records based upon salary)
12. Implement set operations
13. Implement map opearations ( e.g. Mailing list prepation)
14. Implement hash table operations (e.g tic-tae-toe )
15. Graph representation and implement graph traversal algorithm.
16. Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm using graph (e.g. Find the shortest
    route to connect one city to another)

** COURSE OUTCOMES
At the end of the course, the student should be able to:
- Implement linear data structures to solve the given problem(K3)
- Implement nonlinear data structures and use them for various
  applications (K3)
- Analyze a problem statement and suggest an appropriate linear/
  nonlinear data structure for solving it (K4)
- Implement sorting and searching algorithms(K3)
- Implement hash table, sets and maps and use them (K3).
